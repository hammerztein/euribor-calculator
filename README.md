# Euribor Calculator

As a homeowner that pays monthly mortgage installments, this was my first "app" idea that I thought of as a beginner to keep track on my monthly payments and changes in fluctuating Euribor rates. This app was my first "real" app as a beginner that helped me understand some basics of HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

<small>**Update**

<small>The initial app design and logic implementation was done about 2 years ago when I just started to learn about front-end development, hence the missing commits.

## How To Use

User-interface should be pretty self-explanatory, but just in case:

- Input data into all required fields (_loan sum, repayment date, base interest rate and euribor interest rate_)
- Hit calculate button
- To calculate payment difference add a current monthly payment into into specificed field.

## Features

- Calculate monthly payments based on the EMI formula.
- Calculate a difference between 'current' and 'new' monthly payments

## Things I Used

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements
- Flexbox design

## To Do

- Add check for infinity or negative in monthly payments
- Add check for date so that it cant be less than at least 2 months from today.
