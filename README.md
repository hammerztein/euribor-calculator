# Euribor Calculator

As a homeowner that pays monthly mortgage installments, this was my first "app" idea that I thought of as a beginner to keep track on my monthly payments and changes in fluctuating Euribor rates. This app was my first "real" app as a beginner that helped me understand some basics of HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

<small>**Update**

<small>The initial app design and logic (_and Estonian language_) implementation was done about 2 years ago when I just started to learn about front-end development, hence the missing commits.
